# CisRegModels
Scripts for building computational models of gene regulation with tensorflow

# Installation
We recommend using Anaconda and pip to install this.  Due to some dependencies with other (poorly written/distributed) packages, installation is not one step, but it is nearly so

This module requires tensorflow (ideally with GPU support since execution time is orders of magnitude slower without GPUs), as well as several other standard python modules

1. Install CisRegModels:
`pip install git+https://github.com/Carldeboer/CisRegModels`

2. That's it! It should work now (please let me know if you encounter problems)

# Testing the installation
1. Clone the git repo somewhere:
`git clone https://github.com/Carldeboer/CisRegModels`
2. Move into the main directory
`cd CisRegModels`
3. Run the test.
`./test.bat`
